# VeganSupport
My first contact with web development, made after learning the basics of JavaScript through youtube.

Back then, I didn`t even know how to use github yet.

This is the project that made me fall in love with programming, and what motivated me to enroll in a programming college.

It`s only a starting point; far from being finished.

I plan to go back to working on it one day :)
