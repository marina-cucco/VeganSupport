        <h3 id="h3">You selected that you think going vegan <br>might be expensive. </h3>
       
       <br>That is a common assumption, especially when the industry overwhelms us with so many options on a daily basis.
       But that is exactly how these must be seen as: merely options. 
       <br><br> You see; in order to offer supply, the industry usually creates the idea of demand itself - rather it's a high protein pea musli, a gluten free bacon alternative, or a low calorie almond yogurt; all stupidly overpriced - and it expects us to believe that buying these fancy-ass produts is the only way to go.
       <br><br>But there's definetely a different, more sustainable and even healthier way to approach strict vegetarianism (the diet that vegans follow). It does not mean that we should never buy vegan alternatives, or that what we call a vegan diet should be always healthy, always natural, always this or that. It just means that vegans do not need to rely on highly elaborated industrialized products to follow a diet that, in it's core, is about substituting animal-based ingredients with a bigger variety of vegetables, fruits, cereals and so on.
